The Protocol takes the guess-work out of building tokenized economies, providing developers with a seamless experience and benefits from powerful network effects fostered by RLY Network. Below, we explore its core features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"521\" src=\"https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/XTRs38QAL1qPL9tlP5r7v-1024x521.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-709\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/XTRs38QAL1qPL9tlP5r7v-1024x521.webp 1024w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/XTRs38QAL1qPL9tlP5r7v-300x153.webp 300w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/XTRs38QAL1qPL9tlP5r7v-768x390.webp 768w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/XTRs38QAL1qPL9tlP5r7v-1536x781.webp 1536w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/XTRs38QAL1qPL9tlP5r7v-2048x1041.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Above: RLY Protocol enables developers to easily launch Token Economies.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Align Incentives With Your Community<\/strong>&nbsp;Developers can ensure that they\u2019re in-step with their community by leveraging RLY Protocol\u2019s Incentive Alignment features. Our native ERC-20 token, RLY token, has a fixed supply of 15 billion tokens which will be released over the course of 8 years. Approximately 50% of the RLY supply has been allocated to automated rewards for RLY Network contributors, meaning developers can easily secure financial value from their work. Grants from RLY Network Association and RLY Ecosystem DAO, a fund dedicated to supporting RLY Network, are also available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, the Protocol will offer Wallet Scoring, which will index and aggregate wallet-level token flows and app usage. Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter to get upcoming announcements for this feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Launch Tokens With Instant Pricing &amp; Liquidity<\/strong><br>RLY Protocol offers Token Bonding Curves\u2014mathematical formulas that define the relationship between a token\u2019s supply and asset price\u2014to provide instant price discovery, immediate liquidity, and nurture network effects. Likewise,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rly-network.gitbook.io\/rly-protocol\/getting-started\/rly-protocol-quick-start-guide\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">developers can take advantage of our token design templates and libraries<\/a>, which contain illustrative token economic designs based on RLY Network project launches. These resources contain guidance on topics such as navigating liquidity fragmentation and the effective use of both fungible and non-fungible tokens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Earn RLY Rewards to Grow your App<\/strong><br>RLY Network believes in aligned incentives between members of the ecosystem. RLY Protocol offers builders the opportunity to earn&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/rly-network.gitbook.io\/rly-protocol\/rly-rewards\/rly-network-rewards\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">RLY Rewards<\/a>: RLY tokens sent to the wallet of the developer when the token economy of the app is growing. These earnings can be used to fund future growth of the app, fund operating costs, or to share with community members, the choice is up to the developer. Entrepreneurs can earn rewards from RLY Protocol, without giving away equity in a fundraising event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make Your Vision Multi-chain<\/strong>&nbsp;RLY Protocol makes use of popular token bridges to enable developers to bring RLY to their preferred chain via canonical wrappers. Likewise, RLY Protocol offers chain-specific modifications to RLY, Token Bonding Curves, RLY Rewards computations, and Wallet Scoring. Developers can also benefit from Swap Routing\u2014efficient trade execution across multiple on-chain liquidity pools for tokens bonded to RLY via Token Bonding Curves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RLY Protocol In Action: the Growing RLY Network<\/strong>&nbsp;RLY Protocol has already been applied to a variety of use cases, including the creator economy, social networks, fantasy sports, messaging platforms, loyalty programs, and games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0-1024x577.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-710\" srcset=\"https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0-1024x577.webp 1024w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0-300x169.webp 300w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0-768x433.webp 768w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0-1536x865.webp 1536w, https:\/\/rly.network\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/0fHMcI5EWeG_wQC1FOi-0-2048x1154.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Above: RLY Network is powered by RLY Protocol token economy software suite, a multi-chain, permissionless, no-fee, open-source protocol for developers.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RLY Network is steadily growing as communities across a range of industries seek better incentive alignment, more ownership, and the ability to participate in governance, including in: social apps, SoFi, media and entertainment, NFT communities, metaverse apps, and many more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to join us?
